This Python script provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques. It utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and NumPy for image processing and array manipulation.
To run this code in Visual Studio Code, ensure you have the following:
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Install the PIL library using pip: "pip install pillow"
1. Enter the path to the image file you want to encrypt/decrypt.
2. The script will generate a random key and use it for encryption.
3. Encrypted and decrypted images will be saved in the same directory as encrypted_image.png and decrypted_image.png, respectively.
